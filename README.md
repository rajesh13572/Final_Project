# Simple Interest Calculator 💰

This repository contains a simple shell script (`simple-interest.sh`) designed to calculate the Simple Interest (SI) and the Total Amount for a given principal, rate, and time period.

## ⚙️ Formula Used

The script utilizes the standard formula for simple interest:

$$ \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} $$

Where:
* **P** is the Principal Amount.
* **R** is the Annual Rate of Interest (in percent).
* **T** is the Time Period (in years).

The **Total Amount (A)** is calculated as:
$$ \text{Total Amount (A)} = P + \text{SI} $$
